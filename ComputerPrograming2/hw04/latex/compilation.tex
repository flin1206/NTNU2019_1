Save the following code to {\ttfamily makefile}.

Notice that c\+U\+RL has a program, {\ttfamily curl-\/config}, that behaves like {\ttfamily pkg-\/config}, but is c\+U\+R\+L-\/specific.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{CFLAGS =-\/g -\/Wall -\/O3  `curl-\/config -\/-\/cflags` -\/I/usr/include/libxml2}
\DoxyCodeLine{LDLIBS=`curl-\/config -\/-\/libs ` -\/lxml2}
\DoxyCodeLine{CC=c99}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{nyt\_feed:}
\end{DoxyCode}


Having saved your makefile, use {\ttfamily make nyt\+\_\+feed} to compile.

Of course, you have to have the development packages for libcurl and libxml2 installed for this to work.
